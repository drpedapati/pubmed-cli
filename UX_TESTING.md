# Usability Testing Notes (historical)

The findings below describe behavior from the earlier AI-enabled release and are **not representative** of the current `main` command set.

## Current Status on `main`

- Command set is intentionally minimal: `search`, `fetch`, `cited-by`, `references`, `related`, and `mesh`.
- No synthesis/QA/wizard workflow is part of this branch.
- Use this note for migration context only.

## Legacy Observations to Retire

- Prior test plans referenced `synth`, natural-language question execution, and `wizard`.
- JSON and CLI output tests for those flows are now scoped to `ai-features` branch only.
